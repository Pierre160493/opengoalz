# OpenGoalz

OpenGoalz is an open-source football management game of amateur football. You manage all of the club's decisions in order to climb the ranks and be the best club! The goal is to create a more realistic and dynamic experience (than Hattrick or FM), playable online against other managers.

## Overview

OpenGoalz is structured to provide a dynamic and realistic football management experience. Below are the key aspects of the game, each explained in detail in the wiki (<https://github.com/Pierre160493/opengoalz/wiki>):
