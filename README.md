**OpenGoalz** is an open-source football management game of amateur football.

You manage all of the club's decisions in order to climb the ranks and be the best club against other managers online !

The goal is to create a more realistic and dynamic experience than Hattrick and a multiplayer experience that is more fun than Football Manager.
