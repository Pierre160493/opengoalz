# TODO

List of things to do in the future.

## Easy

- Display Events of Current Games According to Time.
- Split money for transfers (for example):
  - 4%: For the league.
  - 1%: For international cup.
  - 10%: For previous clubs.
- Slight updates of players' other skills (Leadership, Discipline, etc.) to modify staff weight.
- Change point system to Win/Draw/Loss/Forfeit (4/2/1/0) instead of (3/1/0/0) ???

## Medium

- Game Simulation Extra Cases: Handle injuries, substitutions, and free kicks.
- Make a trigger on the cash column of the clubs table to perfectly handle money in a closed loop.
- Add players bonus money depending on the number of goals, assists, best scorer etc...
- Weather conditions (rain, snow, etc.) that can affect the game.
- Game start time depending on the time zone of the club.

## Hard

- Solo Mode Like FM Where You Can Advance at Your Speed:
  - Have more multiverses (can start becoming heavy for the database)
  - Possibility of local database (SQLite).
